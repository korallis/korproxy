## Why Consider a Proxy at All?

Tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline have built-in AI integrations. They work out of the box. So why would you route through a local proxy like KorProxy instead?

The answer depends on how you work, what you're paying for, and how much flexibility you need.

## Native Integrations: Pros and Cons

### The Good

**Zero configuration** - Install the tool, sign up, start coding. Native integrations are optimized for their specific tool, with features designed around how that tool works.

**Tight UX integration** - Native AI features can do things external APIs can't—inline suggestions, codebase indexing, tool-specific context. Cursor's Composer, for example, understands your project structure in ways a generic API call doesn't.

**Bundled pricing** - Some tools include AI usage in their subscription. You know exactly what you'll pay each month.

### The Challenges

**Locked to their pricing** - Cursor Pro is $20/month. If you're already paying $20/month for Claude Pro, that's $40/month for what's essentially the same underlying AI. Most native integrations don't let you bring your own subscription.

**Provider restrictions** - Many tools limit which models you can use. Want Claude in a tool that only offers GPT? You're out of luck with native integrations.

**Multiple subscriptions** - If you use multiple tools (Cursor at work, VS Code at home, NeoVim for quick edits), you might need separate AI subscriptions for each—or go without AI in some of them.

## The KorProxy Approach: Pros and Cons

### The Good

**Use existing subscriptions** - Already paying for Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus, or Google AI? KorProxy lets you use those subscriptions in any compatible tool. Stop paying twice.

**Switch providers freely** - KorProxy supports Claude, GPT, and Gemini. Switch between them based on the task, or set up automatic routing. Your tools don't need to support multiple providers—KorProxy handles it.

**One setup, every tool** - Configure KorProxy once. Every tool that supports OpenAI-compatible APIs now has access to your AI providers. Add a new tool? Just point it at `localhost:1337`.

**No usage caps** - Many native integrations meter your AI usage or throttle heavy users. Your personal subscriptions typically have more generous limits.

### The Challenges

**Initial setup required** - You'll spend 5-10 minutes downloading KorProxy, authenticating, and configuring your tools. It's not hard, but it's not zero.

**Local process** - KorProxy runs on your machine. It needs to be running when you want AI features. It's lightweight (uses minimal RAM), but it's there.

**Some native features unavailable** - Tool-specific AI features that require deep integration (like Cursor's codebase indexing) may not work through KorProxy. You're using the AI for chat and completions, not proprietary features.

## Decision Framework: When to Use Each

### Use Native Integrations When:

- **You're new to AI coding tools** - Start with the simplest path. Learn what you actually use before optimizing.
- **You need tool-specific features** - If Cursor's Composer or Copilot's inline suggestions are essential to your workflow, use them natively.
- **You only use one tool** - If Cursor is your only AI-enabled editor and you don't have other AI subscriptions, the native experience is hard to beat.
- **Your company pays** - If your employer covers Cursor Pro, use it. Don't optimize costs that aren't yours.

### Use KorProxy When:

- **You have existing AI subscriptions** - Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus, or Google AI subscriptions you're already paying for. Put them to work.
- **You use multiple tools** - Cursor at work, Cline for personal projects, Continue for quick experiments. One KorProxy setup covers all of them.
- **You want provider flexibility** - Sometimes Claude is better for your task. Sometimes GPT is faster. KorProxy lets you switch or route intelligently.
- **You value cost efficiency** - Rather than paying $20/month for Cursor Pro + $20/month for Claude Pro, use KorProxy to consolidate.

## The Hybrid Approach

Here's what many power users do: **use both**.

Keep native integrations for tool-specific features you depend on. Use KorProxy for everything else—especially when you want access to a specific model or provider that your tool doesn't natively support.

For example:
- Use Cursor's native Composer for complex multi-file refactors (it understands your codebase)
- Use KorProxy to access Claude when Cursor's native Claude integration is slow or unavailable
- Switch to GPT via KorProxy when you need a different perspective on a problem

## The Bottom Line

Native integrations optimize for simplicity. KorProxy optimizes for flexibility and cost efficiency.

If you're paying for multiple AI subscriptions or using multiple coding tools, KorProxy likely saves you money and gives you more control. If you're all-in on one tool and one provider, native integration is simpler.

Most developers eventually end up wanting both. [Download KorProxy](/) and see where it fits in your workflow.
