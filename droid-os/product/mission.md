# Product Mission

## Pitch
KorProxyV2 is a cross-platform desktop local AI proxy that helps existing KorProxy customers and new developers keep their subscriptions and licenses working with coding tools by migrating to a simpler, more maintainable stack.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- Existing KorProxy subscribers: want a safe migration that preserves accounts, subscriptions, and license checks.
- New AI-tool users: need a reliable local proxy to use their existing AI subscriptions with coding tools.

### User Personas
**Independent Developer** (25-45)
- **Role:** Software engineer using AI coding tools daily
- **Context:** Works across multiple AI providers and needs a stable local proxy
- **Pain Points:** Account re-setup, license failures, and unreliable local proxy behavior
- **Goals:** Seamless migration, reliable authentication, and low-friction daily use

## The Problem

### Migration Risk And Platform Gaps
Moving away from the Electron app risks losing account access, subscription state, and license validation, while Windows users lack a stable KorProxyV2 experience.

**Our Solution:** Deliver a KorProxyV2 migration that preserves existing accounts and subscriptions, matches licensing checks, and ships first-class macOS and Windows builds.

## Differentiators

### Preservation-First Migration
Unlike a clean-slate desktop rewrite, KorProxyV2 preserves existing user accounts, subscription state, and licensing checks.
This results in a lower-risk upgrade with no disruption to active subscriptions.

### Local-First Reliability
Unlike cloud-only proxy tooling, KorProxyV2 runs locally with built-in tray controls, auto-update, and provider-ready proxy routing.
This results in faster setup and day-to-day control without external dependencies.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Account Login And Linking:** Users sign in and retain their existing KorProxy accounts without re-registering.
- **Subscription Sync:** Existing subscription status and entitlements remain intact after migration.
- **License Validation:** License checks match the Electron app behavior to avoid access regressions.
- **Local Proxy Routing:** The local proxy works reliably with AI coding tools and provider accounts.

### Collaboration Features
- **Tool Integration Reliability:** Local proxy connection stays stable across multiple AI tools on the same machine.
- **Status And Controls:** Tray and in-app controls make it easy to monitor and manage proxy state.

### Advanced Features
- **Cross-Platform Installers:** macOS and Windows installers provide consistent onboarding.
- **Auto-Update:** Users receive safe updates without manual reinstallation.
